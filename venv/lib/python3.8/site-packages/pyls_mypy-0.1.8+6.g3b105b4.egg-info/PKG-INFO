        This is a plugin for the Palantir's Python Language Server (https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server)
        
        It, like mypy, requires Python 3.2 or newer.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install into the same virtualenv as pyls itself.
        
        ``pip install pyls-mypy``
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        ``live_mode`` (default is True) provides type checking as you type.
        
        As mypy is unaware of what file path is being checked, there are limitations with live_mode
         - Imports cannot be followed correctly
         - Stub files are not validated correctly
        
        Turning off live_mode means you must save your changes for mypy diagnostics to update correctly.
        
        Depending on your editor, the configuration should be roughly like this:
        
        ::
        
            "pyls":
            {
                "plugins":
                {
                    "pyls_mypy":
                    {
                        "enabled": true,
                        "live_mode": false
                    }
                }
            }
