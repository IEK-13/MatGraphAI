"""
This module defines Django admin classes for the EMMOProcess and EMMOMatter models in the knowledge graph application.
These classes allow for the management of EMMOProcess and EMMOMatter instances in the Django admin interface.

EMMOProcessAdmin and EMMOMatterAdmin inherit from the NodeModelAdmin base class, which is a customized
ModelAdmin class for Neo4j node models. These classes define custom display options and save methods
for EMMOProcess and EMMOMatter instances in the Django admin interface.
